As a fun little task for myself, I marked up my initials (CBPN) in a list and styled them around an Ã—. The main thing to take away from this example is that everything is `em`-based, so that changing the `html` `font-size` will perfectly scale the entire project.

I encourage you to play around in my code and come up with your own variations.
