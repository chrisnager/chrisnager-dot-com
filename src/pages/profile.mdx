I manage a globally distributed Design Technology team responsible for [Carta’s universal design system].

Previously, across Advertising, Technology, and Finance, I’ve built brand experiences for major companies (Luckie), been through a [near-billion dollar acquisition] (BuddyMedia), built [products millions of people use] (Salesforce), helped [launch America’s newest stock exchange] (IEX), was a founding member of a [SaaS startup] (Air), and built a team that helped [launch a private stock exchange] (Carta).

I’ve had opportunities to [speak about my development process], and hosted meetups and internal company teach-ins.

You might see me on the G train, [speed-solving my Rubik’s cube].

I lead with curiosity and empathy. I learn everyday and have a passion for mentoring. As a team leader, I keep a positive attitude to inspire my teammates to give their best efforts.

I care about purpose-driven work.
