![Chris Nager, smiling and wearing a hat](/images/profile/hat.jpg)

I’ve worked across industries, from Advertising to Finance. I’ve been through a [near-billion dollar acquisition], built [products millions of people use], helped [launch America’s newest stock exchange], was a founding member of a [SaaS startup], built a team and helped launch [Carta Liquidity], and currently manage a globally distributed Design Technology team responsible for [Carta’s universal design system].

Pre-quarantine, you may have seen me on the G train, [speed-solving my Rubik’s cube].

I specialize in user experience (UX) and developer experience (DX). I’ve created and worked on design systems just about everywhere I’ve worked. My current passion stack is React, React Native, TypeScript, Jest, Testing Library, Theme-UI, and Gatsby. One thing that sets my work apart is my deep understanding of CSS. I know when and how to use flexbox versus grid layouts, and truly understand the cascade. I’m particularly proud of [Zephyr], the design system I created for Air. It’s built in TypeScript and includes cross-platform (web/iOS/Android) foundations and components.

I’ve had opportunities to [speak about my development process], and hosted meetups and internal company teach-ins.

I lead with curiosity and empathy. I learn everyday and have a passion for mentoring. I have experience with project management—writing tech specs, managing roadmaps, and delegating tasks. As a team leader, I keep a positive attitude to inspire my teammates to give their best efforts.

I care about purpose-driven work.
