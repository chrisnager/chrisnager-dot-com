# Vibe coding with your design system

I discovered a surprisingly effective way to "vibe code" interfaces using a custom design system.

Here's how I used AI + [Ink](https://ink.carta.com/components/Button/examples), Carta's robust design system, to rapidly prototype production-ready UIs without writing a line of code.

I started by scraping Ink's public documentation. Using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev), I wrote a script that stitched all the docs into a single 730-page PDF. Then, I fed the PDF into [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google), Google’s AI-powered research assistant.

That’s when the magic happened. ✨

I opened a chat in NotebookLM and began describing my UI ideas. The model responded with code that used accurate Ink components with their specific variants and options. I pasted the code into [Playroom](https://ink.carta.com/playroom/#?code=N4Igxg9gJgpiBcIA8AhCAPABAQwDa4F4AdEAcwFcAXSmAJxID4iA7TTJACQGVLswBrJqzbsUVShGYMAIjABm2crkpIA9GOqShI0eMmZKATwAOMYiGO0AlgFtstQ4wAK1uw7UaJUljtR7WRqbmUNjMpHSM0qHhtB7%2B2uyq3LwCQh4YQiAANCAA7lZQlAAWAM4IANrgeGAAFACMAAwNAG65mAC0mHUATA3G6ACUIAC6AL5AA), Ink’s live code sandbox to see my rendered prototype. From there, I iterated through prompts, refining the layout and interactions.

No context switching, just high-fidelity, brand-aligned UI, fast.

# Why rapid prototyping with a custom design system is important

NotebookLM is not a prototyping tool _at all_. However, I've used (and built) AI code generation and prototyping tools over the years, and haven't seen output so true to a custom design system like I have when using NotebookLM. Existing AI prototyping tools are excellent when going from 0 to 1 (starting from scratch), but one area they've all fallen short is when trying to apply a custom design system.

This technique isn’t just about speeding up prototyping, it’s about unlocking a bring-your-own-design-system future where _anyone_ within a company can now test design ideas and output production-ready code that’s accessible, performant, and _on-brand_.

My approach is far from a final solution, but is a proof of possibility. If your company values branding, consistency, and speed, making your design system AI-legible could be a game-changing investment. The next frontier isn’t just establishing design systems—it's how we talk to them.
