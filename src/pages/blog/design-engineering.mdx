# Design engineering

# Who is a DE

Design engineer (or design technologist) is an emerging role many companies are adding to their roster.

I see DE as a natural move to a role between established roles.

# Establish credibility

As someone who has spent near 5 years in this [role], I wanted to share my perspective on why this is an important role and what the expectations may be for a design engineer.

I've put together resources and rubrics for DEs, and figured it may be helpful to others for me to share my perspective.

# What DEs do

It's about craft.

It may be obvious that DE is at the intersection of Design and Engineering. But diving a bit deeper, we can see what may be expected or a DE.

It's important as a hiring manager to know what your team needs.

I studied design, I know and use design principles, and have always had an excitement and passion for using code as my medium of choice.

DE is for me.

At Carta, I manage a globally distributed team of DEs responsible for Carta's universal design system. Our DS metrics show that over 100,000 ink components are in use across Carta's suite of products. (This is a story for another post.)

We serve designers and engineerineers by offering documented and tested Figma components and code components.

Quality software should no longer be seen as a differentiator, but an expectation. Customers deserve intuitive, accessible UIs.

DEs help keep the quality bar high.

# What do DEs do?

Skills range among DEsâ€”some with more technical background, and others with product design backgrounds.

DEs are quick to prototype to test design hypotheses. DEs are capable of shiping production code. DEs collaborate in Figma (or other design tools) with visual and product designers to refine interactions by knowing and explaining the technical considerations of design decisions.

And one of the most important skills DEs possess is the ability to communicate with both designers and engineers, giving feedback to both sides, and acting as a bit of a translator between the two worlds through prototypes.

# Why your organization may need a DE

TL;DR reasons to hire a DE:
- you need a design system created, upleveled, or maintained
- you need to raise your design quality in your software products
- you'd like to tastefully apply animations or advanced layouts to your site or app
- you want someone that will carry the torch for craft from designers to engineering
- you need to test designs in code with prototypes

# How DEs contribute

- Design in Figma
- 
- Contribute to design system
