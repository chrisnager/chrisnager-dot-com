# Design engineering

Design engineer (or design technologist) is an emerging role many companies are adding to their roster. This unique role is the mortar between the visual and technical bricks. And is enjoyable.

In 2021, I was tasked with building and leading a design engineering team. Before putting the job descriptions together, I asked myself “how will design engineers positively impact our organization?” and “what are the expectations of a design engineer?”

I’ve built design engineering teams, and put together resources and leveling guides for design engineers.

As Carta’s sole design engineering manager, I now manage a globally distributed team of design engineers responsible for Carta's universal design system. Our design system metrics show that over 100,000 ink components are in use across Carta's suite of products.

This post is my many-years perspective on, and appreciation for, design engineering. I’ll explain why design engineering is an important role and what the expectations may be for a design engineer.





## Why design engineering is important

Quality software should no longer be seen as a differentiator, but an expectation. Customers deserve intuitive, accessible user interfaces.

Design engineers help keep the quality bar high by championing page performance, accessibility, user delight, viewport responsiveness, and reusability of components/tokens.

Design engineers solve design problems with code. 

It's about craft. Design engineers are curious across disciplines.

It's important as a hiring manager to know what your team needs.

Our design system team serves both designers and engineers by offering documented and tested components in Figma and code. Not only do we create reusable components and documentation, our team creates tools and guides help designers and engineers move faster.

Our design engineers share a deep concern for the user experience (UX) and the developer experience (DX).





## Expectations for a design engineer

The most important skill design engineers possess is the ability to communicate with both designers and frontend engineers. They’re able to give feedback to both sides, and can act as a translator between the two worlds through prototypes.

Design engineers are quick to prototype to test design hypotheses. They’re capable of shipping production code. They collaborate in Figma (or other design tools) with visual and product designers to refine interactions, and can explain the technical considerations of design decisions. Depending on the team or business needs, design engineers may work on a company's design system, external marketing sites, branding, or product development.

Skills range among design engineers—some with more technical background, and others with more product design backgrounds. (?)

Design engineers may be on platform teams, like Carta's ink design system team, or embedded in product teams. Expectations of these roles differ based on team and business needs.





## Concluding thoughts

Design engineering will continue to evolve as our tools do. The ability to contribute to both design and frontend engineering will be an increasingly valuable skill. The demand for quality software will rise, and design engineers will help meet that need. I’m excited to watch and contribute to the expansion of design engineering.
