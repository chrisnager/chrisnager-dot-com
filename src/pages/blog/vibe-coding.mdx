# Vibe coding

I recently [vibe coded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) a 3D game I named [Snowball](https://chrisnager.com/snowball/). Inspired by the mechanics of [Katamari Damacy](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Katamari+Damacy&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), the player controls a snowball that grows in size when snow is collected, and shrinks when it comes in contact with lava.

For this particular project, I went all-in on vibe codingâ€”meaning I let AI do 98+% of the development, and I did my best to not touch the code.

I began the project using Anthropic's [Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet) through [Cline](https://cline.bot) in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), which makes for a pretty great workflow.

However, I ultimately used:
- Google DeepMind's [Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/) for the project planning and code
- OpenAI's [GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/) model for generating images for the in-game textures (like snow and lava); and
- [Suno v4](https://suno.com) for generating the background music.

Snowball is the first project I've created using [Three.js](https://threejs.org), a web-based 3D game engine. It's playable on desktop or mobile, using the arrow keys and an on-screen joystick, respectively.

I submitted Snowball to the [2025 Vibe Jam](https://jam.pieter.com), created by [levelsio](https://x.com/levelsio), judged by [karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy) ([who coined the term "vibe coding"](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383)), [mrdoob](https://x.com/mrdoob), [s13k](https://x.com/s13k_), [timsoret](https://x.com my early days of/timsoret), and levelsio himself.

I restarted the project a handful of times, but once I got in a rhythm, I found myself having a ton of fun creating this game. It sparked a similar joy to my early days of learning web development in the first place. Bringing my ideas and designs to life has always felt special. I learned a ton about working with Three.js, and got a small taste of the many aspects to creating even a simple game. I let go of my code purist mindset, and vibed.

At the very least, creating Snowball helped me with prompting AI systems for what I wanted. It will only get easier to work with these systems, but clear communication will always be important. To give an anology, it's simple to ask for a burger, but to get extra onions, with cheese, and no pickles, it's imporant to specify your order.

Have some fun, learn new things, and vibe code responsibly.
