[![Chris Nager 2012 mock campaign site](http://chrisnager.com/assets/Chris-Nager-2012.jpg "Chris Nager 2012")](http://chrisnager.com/forpresident/2012)

This is a mock campaign site I set up for myself to express some creativity and practice my responsive designing. Responsive web design is a way of building websites where the content is the driving force and the design adapts to the users device, whether it be a laptop computer or a mobile phone. See my presidential campaign site and try out the responsive design by resizing your browser window.
